%% Author notes
. Credit goes both my dear friend Jakub and me. Both of us made this project for classes, where he was more responsible for SQL database setup
and i was responsible for backend with data processing as well as UI

Folder "packages" is too large to upload to github, so i included "packages.txt", where all
needed NuGet Packages are included by name with their used version 

Project is not perfect (none is), not able to display everything without connnection to local database
as well as same signal acquisition is rather primitive and works 60% of the time. Project need
some care and time, which i unfortunatelt dont have at this moment
